# nsw-lotto
ruby script for NSW lotto predict. 

This script is suitable to generate games for NSW lotto, including:

OZ Lotto
PowerBall
Saturday Lotto

example:
ruby lotto.rb

reminder: please create 'mailist' file under the path. also use the postfix file as configuration reference if you would want to use postfix as the mail agent.

results are generated into a html file. I am using nginx to host it, you can see the result at : https://www.timetxt.com .

I am writing this script cause I want to combin the Ruby Learning with something interesting. Gambling is not the purpose of this script and actually there is no secret algorithm for NSW lotto inside this script. All the number-pick-up things are handled by Ruby Standard Library.

Good luck in playing NSW Lotto. Finger Crossed! Have Fun!
